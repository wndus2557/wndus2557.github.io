 **Let f (P) = f ( x , y , z ) be a scalar function having continuous first partial derivatives in some     domain B in space. Then grad f exists in B and is a vector, that is, its length and direction are     independent of the particular choice of Cartesian coordinates. If                          at some point P,     it has the direction of maximum increase of f at P.**

 **Differential Geometry**  • A mathematical discipline that uses the methods of differential and integral calculus to study     problems in geometry  • It plays a role in mechanics, computer-aided and traditional engineering design, geodesy and     geography, space travel, and relativity theory 

Vector Fields That Are Gradients of Scalar Fields (“Potentials”) • f (t) is potential function of v(P) : v(P) = grad f (P) • Vector field is conservative : energy is conserved in a vector field 

**Theorem 1** Rotating Body and Curl    The curl of the velocity field of a rotating rigid body has the direction of the axis of the rotation,    and its magnitude equals twice the angular speed of the rotation.

 • Gradient fields are irrotational.                                            **curl (grad f ) = 0**

 • The divergence of the curl of a function is zero.                 **div ( curl v ) = 0**
